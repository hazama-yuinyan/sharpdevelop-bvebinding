BVE5 Language Binding for SharpDevelop beta release

3/22/2013
(C) HAZAMA


Thank you for downloading. The BVE5 Language Binding addin adds syntax highlighting, code completion and some other useful tools for building BVE5 Routes to the SharpDevelop IDE. Since it's still in alpha release stage, it may have bugs and room for improvement. So if you have found any bugs or have any suggestions, please feel free to post them on, say, Github.

--How to install--
If you already have SharpDevelop installed on your computer, then it must be as easy as double-clicking the "BVE5Binding.sdaddin" file. Otherwise, you must download the latest SharpDevelop alpha release and install it before proceeding to the above step.

--Requirements--
I only have tested on the SharpDevelop alpha release version(4.3.0.9338). So I strongly recommend you use at least 4.3 version of SharpDevelop.

--History--
3/07/2013 alpha version released

3/22/2013 beta version released

Happy coding for BVE5 routes!
